## Introduction
Mule application can contain multiple flows and sub-flows. All these can reference each other for processing messages. Data can also be exchanged synchronously or asynchronously using connectors.

A project can easily have multiple configuration files with flows/sub-flows that are spread across those files. When analyzing mule application, it could be difficult to see the complete data processing flow and their dependencies.

Have you ever wished to visualize your flow dependencies? How does message flows through your application?

If so, then try this `muleflowdiagrams` application. It can read your configuration files and generate a diagrams that can easily tell you how your flows are connected.

[source, bash]
----
$ muleflowdiagrams
Missing required parameter: <sourcePath>
Usage: muleflowdiagrams [-hV] [-d=<diagramType>] [-o=<outputFilename>]
						[-t=<targetPath>] <sourcePath>
Create Flow diagrams from mule configuration files.
	<sourcePath>   Source directory path containing mule configuration files
-d, --diagram=<diagramType>
					Type of diagram to generate. Valid values: GRAPH, SEQUENCE
					Default: GRAPH
-h, --help         Show this help message and exit.
-o, --out=<outputFilename>
					Name of the output file
					Default: mule-diagram
-t, --target=<targetPath>
					Output directory path to generate diagram
-V, --version      Print version information and exit.

For an example mule configuration link:./itests/test-hello-app.xml[./itests/test-hello-app.xml], run following command to generate a flow diagram -

[source, bash]
----
$ muleflowdiagrams ./itests/test-hello-app.xml -t ./itests/output

## Features
* Visualize mule flow dependencies and data flow.
* Identify unused mule flows and sub-flows.
* Identify flow spaghetti situations
* Visualize synchronous and asynchronous data processing points
* Identify connector dependencies and usage
* Detect a possible recursive flow loops.

## Requirements
At the minimum, Java 8 is required. The build pipeline also tests it against JDK 11+.

Tested and verified to use on OSX, Linux and Windows.

## Installation

### Homebrew

(TODO)

### Manual install
. Unzip the https://github.com/manikmagar/mule-flow-diagrams/releases/latest[latest binary release].
. Add `muleflowdiagrams-<version>/bin` folder in to your $PATH
. Test running `muleflowdiagrams --version` in CLI.

### Build and Run
This project uses Gradle to compile and build. To create a zip distribution, run below command in project directory -
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew distZip
----

To install the distribution, run `./gradlew installDist`. This will explode the generated zip file to `./build/install` directory. You can verify binaries by executing `sh build/install/muleflowdiagrams/bin/muleflowdiagrams --version`.
