== Introduction
Mule application can contain multiple flows and sub-flows. All these can reference each other for processing messages. Data can also be exchanged synchronously or asynchronously using connectors.

A project can easily have multiple configuration files with flows/sub-flows that are spread across those files. When analyzing mule application, it could be difficult to see the complete data processing flow and their dependencies.

Have you ever wished to visualize your flow dependencies? How does message flows through your application?

If so, then try this `mulefd` application. It can read your configuration files and generate a diagrams that can easily tell you how your flows are connected.

== Requirements
At the minimum, Java 8 is required. The build pipeline also tests it against JDK 11+.

Tested and verified to use on OSX, Linux and Windows.

== Installation

=== SDKMan icon:linux[] icon:apple[]

Recommended way to install both java and Mule flow diagrams is https://sdkman.io[sdkman] for Linux and OSX.

To https://sdkman.io/install[install] SDKMAN and Java -
[source, bash]
----
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

sdk install java
----

Once Java is installed and ready, you install Mule Flow Diagrams -

[source, bash]
----
sdk install mulefd
----

To test your installation run:

[source, bash]
----
mulefd --help
----

This should print out usage information.

For upgrading existing installations via SDKMAN,run:

[source]
----
sdk upgrade mulefd
----

=== Homebrew icon:apple[]

On OSX you can install 'java' and `mulefd` with https://brew.sh[Homebrew] using custom taps.

To install Java 8:

[source, bash]
----
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
----

Once Java is installed you can use brew with https://github.com/manikmagar/homebrew-tap/[manikmagar/tap] to get `mulefd`:

`brew install manikmagar/tap/mulefd`

To upgrade to the latest version:

`brew upgrade manikmagar/tap/mulefd`

Test running `mulefd --help` in CLI.

=== Docker icon:docker[]
If you don't want to install `mulefd`, you can run it via docker.

[source,bash]
----
docker run -v `pwd`:/app manikmagar/mulefd /app
----

This will generate diagrams in `pwd` or mounted directory.

Docker container resources are limited. Based on the size of your application, you may see outofmemory errors when executing with docker. You can allocate more memory with `-m` option to docker run command, Eg. `-m 512m`.

=== Scoop icon:windows[]
On Windows, you can install `mulefd` using https://scoop.sh[Scoop] - A command-line installer for Windows.

Once you have Scoop installed and JDK configured, you can run following commands to get `mulefd` -

[source,bash]
----
scoop bucket add manikmagar https://github.com/manikmagar/scoop-bucket
scoop install mulefd
----

To upgrade, you can run -

[source,bash]
----
scoop update mulefd
----

=== Manual install icon:apple[] icon:windows[] icon:linux[]
. Unzip the https://github.com/manikmagar/mulefd/releases/latest[latest binary release].
. Add `mulefd-<version>/bin` folder in to your $PATH
. Test running `mulefd --help` in CLI.

=== Build and Run
This project uses Gradle to compile and build. To create a zip distribution, run below command in project directory -
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew distZip
----

To install the distribution -

. Clone the project
. Run `./gradlew installDist`. This will explode the generated zip file to `./build/install` directory.
. You can verify binaries by executing -
.. icon:apple[] icon:linux[] : `sh build/install/mulefd/bin/mulefd --help`
.. icon:windows[] : `./build/install/mulefd/bin/mulefd.bat --help`

== Usage

`mulefd` support various arguments for generating diagrams.

Example:
`mulefd ~/AnypointStudio/studio-workspace/mulefd-demo`

[source, bash]
----
$ mulefd
Missing required parameter: '<sourcePath>'
Usage: mulefd [-hV] [-gs] [-d=<diagramType>] [-fl=<flowName>]
						[-o=<outputFilename>] [-t=<targetPath>] <sourcePath>
Create Flow diagrams from mule configuration files.
	<sourcePath>        Source directory path containing mule configuration
							files
-d, --diagram=<diagramType>
						Type of diagram to generate. Valid values: GRAPH,
							SEQUENCE
							Default: GRAPH
-fl, --flowname=<flowName>
						Target flow name to generate diagram for. All
							flows/subflows not related to this flow will be
							excluded from the diagram.
-gs, --genSingles   Generate individual diagrams for each flow.
-h, --help              Show this help message and exit.
-o, --out=<outputFilename>
						Name of the output file
							Default: mule-diagram
-t, --target=<targetPath>
						Output directory path to generate diagram
-V, --version           Print version information and exit.

*_Out of memory errors?_*

If your application is large and contains too many flows, process could fail with `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error.

Try increasing the JVM allocated memory using `-Xmx` flag.

[source,bash]
----
$ JAVA_OPTS='-Xmx1024m' mulefd ~/AnypointStudio/studio-workspace/mulefd-demo
----

For windows, you may need to set it at environment level -

[source,bash]
----
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Xmx1024m
mulefd.bat ~/AnypointStudio/studio-workspace/mulefd-demo
----


=== Source directory
Source directory is a required argument. This argument specifies where mule xml configuration files be searched.

This argument value can be one of the following:

* Path of the individual mule xml file. Eg. `~/Downloads/test-app-config.xml`. In this case, diagram for just this file is generated.
* Path to a standard mule 4 or mule 3 project root. Eg. `~/AnypointStudio/studio-workspace/mulefd-demo`.
** Mule 3: All configurations from `src/main/app/` are scanned to generate a diagram.
** Mule 4: All configurations from `src/main/mule/` are scanned to generate a diagram.
* Path to any non-mule project directory.

=== Generate Individual flow diagrams
When running against a large mule application, the generated `mule-diagram.png` can contain too many flows. To simplify understanding each flow, it can be helpful to generate diagrams per flow (not sub-flows).

You can specify `-gs` or `--genSingles` option to generate individual flow diagrams, in addition to the consolidated one.

These diagrams are generated at `{targetPath}/single-flow-diagrams/{currentDateTime}` directory. Each generated diagram has the same name as flow it represents.

NOTE: Some flow names, especially the APIKit generated flows can contain characters not valid for some OS. Names are thus sanitized. Any character not in `a-zA-Z0-9.-` is replaced with `_`.

=== Flowname
If you just want to generate diagram for a single flow then specify it with `-fl` or `--flowname` option. This will exclude all flows and subflows that are not related to this target flow.

=== Diagram Types
Current release supports generating `Graph` diagram only.

=== Output arguments
Target directory to output generated diagram can be specified with `-t {directoryPath}` option. This is an optional argument and defaults to the source directory (or parent directory if source is a file).

The file name for diagram defaults to `mule-diagram.png`. This can be changed by specifying `-o {filename}` argument.

== Known modules/connectors
Mule has many connectors/modules that can be used for building flows and sub-flows. This list keeps growing. This tool maintains a list of known components with their supported operations for including in the generate diagram.

You can find this list in source code link:src/main/resources/default-mule-components.csv[].

Each record in this file has following columns -

[source, csv]
----
prefix,operation,sourceFlag,path,configName,async

----
* **prefix**: Namespace of module/connector. eg. `vm`
* **operation**: Name of the operations or input source in that namespace. eg. `listener`, `consume` in `vm` etc.
* **sourceFlag**: `true` if `operation` is an input source withing that namespace. eg. `listener` in `vm`.
* **path**: Name of the attribute on operation which can help identify resource path. eg. `queueName` for `vm:listener` or `path` for `http:request`. For sources, this is visible on source nodes in diagram.
* **configName**: Name of the module configuration. For sources, this is visible on source nodes in diagram. This can help identify source uniquely when multiple configuration exists.
* **async**: `true` if this is an asynchronous operation. Defaults to `false`.

=== Registering custom modules
If any module is missing in the default list - either being a new module or a custom module, then it is possible for users to register their modules.

If `mulefd-components.csv` named CSV file exists in `sourcePath`, then all modules/connectors within that file are registered as known components. Structure of this file must be same as default components file explained above.

See example file at link:src/test/resources/mulefd-components.csv[].
