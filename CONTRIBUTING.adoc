= Contributing

Anyone is welcome to open issues and/or pull-requests for bugfixes, feature-requests and/or ideas.

== How to build

Clone the repository, cd `mulefd` and run `./gradlew build`.
There will be a warning in the output but don't despair - that is just
Java being picky.

[source, bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/manikmagar/mulefd
$ cd mulefd
$ ./gradlew build
----

== Conventional Commits + squash and merge

To make releasing as automated and fast as possible we (since 05-Oct-2020) use https://www.conventionalcommits.org.

*TODO:* Add https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests on PRs to sanitize that at least PR title or one commit uses the conventional commit format.

Intent is that on merge we squash to get as clean as changelog as possible.

== Source formatting

The build uses the https://github.com/diffplug/spotless[spotless] plugin to ensure Java and other files are formatted uniformly.
If your build fails due to formatting errors then run `./gradlew spotlessApply` and it will reformat to be compatible.

== Versioning

`mulefd` uses semi-automatic versioning via the https://github.com/toolebox-io/gradle-git-versioner[git-versioner] plugin.
This plugin uses the git log to derive what version number are the current one by looking for `[major]`, `[minor]` and `[patch]` in commit messages.

This means there is no place in code or meta-data that we need to manually maintain version info.

You can see the current version by running `./gradlew printVersion` - if you have 3 commits since last bump at `0.10.1` you would get a version number like `0.10.1.3`.

For pull-requests don't try and trigger bump of a version; we'll apply that once its time for release.

NOTE: The `com.javastreets.mulefd.app.VersionProvider` class will show a compile error in IDE's but ignore that, the `BUILDCONFIG` class gets generated during the Gradle build.

== How releases are made

Run a build check to see if things are clean:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./gradlew spotlessApply build clean
----

if nothing changed (use `git status`) then run:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./gradlew printVersion
----

to see if the right version are printed.
If should have only 3 digits, i.e. `v0.45.1`, not `v0.45.1.23`.

If 4 digits then make sure last commit as a `[minor]` or `[patch]` as part of its text.

Once ready run:

`$ ./gradlew changelog`

This will generate `CHANGELOG.md` using commitizen conventions.

Edit the changelog with some header on what changed in an overview form.

Then run:

`$ ./gradlew tag`

This will create an annotated tag using the `CHANGELOG.md` message.

If all is good, run `$ gradle push --tags`.

This will trigger github action flow which will prepare a github release.

When all is good - go to https://github.com/manikmagar/mulefd/releases and check all is good;
do final (cosmetic) edits on the release message and save.

When saved, a github action workflow will get triggered. That workflow will push update the distribution mechanism for brew, container, scoop, sdkman etc.
